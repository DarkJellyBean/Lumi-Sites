            <h2>🌌 Preface: The Solar Blackout Problem</h2>
            <p>
                How do we talk to Mars? Usually, we use the Deep Space Network—giant radio dishes. But what happens when Mars is on the other side of the Sun? For weeks, the Sun's "noise" blocks all communication. We're in a <span class="text-glow-gold">solar blackout</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sky Pulse is a new idea for an "always-on" network. It's not a replacement for high-speed radio, but a resilient backup. It’s a way to send critical, low-bandwidth data (like a "heartbeat" or a status check) *without* worrying about where the planets are. 🦋
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section Card: The Core Idea -->
        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>📡 I. The Core Concept: Ringing a Planet's Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p>
                You can't just shout to Mars. But what if you could "ring" the entire planet Earth like a giant, invisible bell?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is possible thanks to <span class="text-glow-gold">Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)</span>—the physics of how gasses (like our upper atmosphere) and magnetic fields interact. Every planet with a magnetic field has natural "ringing" frequencies, or <span class="text-glow-gold">eigenmodes</span>. Think of it as the planet's natural, background 'hum' (like the 7.83 Hz Schumann Resonance on Earth).
            </p>
            <p>
                Sky Pulse works by gently 'plucking' one of these notes with a tiny signal, encoding data onto it. This 'ring' vibrates through the entire planet's magnetic field, making it detectable from far away.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section Card: The Signal -->
        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>✨ II. How to Send a Whisper: "Spread-Spectrum"</h2>
            <p>
                The "ring" from a Sky Pulse is softer than a whisper. To hide it from noise (and for safety), the signal is "smeared" across a wide frequency. This is a technique called <span class="text-glow-gold">Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum</span> (DSSS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of shouting on one frequency, Sky Pulse "whispers" by encoding the data (using BPSK or QPSK) into what looks like random static. To a normal radio, it's invisible. But to a receiver that knows the "secret pattern" of the static, the message is crystal clear.
            </p>

        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>🧠 III. How to Hear a Whisper: "Beamforming"</h2>
            <p>
                The Sun is magnetically *screaming*, and even lightning on Earth creates massive noise. The signal is buried deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, how do you hear it? You don't use one "ear" (sensor); you use a whole array of them, spread across the ground. By combining their signals, computers can use a technique called <span class="text-glow-gold">beamforming</span>. It's like a digital "smart filter" (the paper calls it MVDR) that can lock onto the exact "fingerprint" of the Sky Pulse signal, tuning out all the random, screaming noise.

        <!-- Section Card: The "Quantum Clock" -->
        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>⌛ IV. The 'Impossible' Problem: Keeping Perfect Time</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the catch. For that smart filter to work, *every sensor* in the network—even one on Earth and one on Mars—must be timed together perfectly, down to the *femtosecond* (a millionth of a billionth of a second).
            </p>
            <p>
                A normal clock can't do this. Because of Einstein's relativity, time itself literally "ticks" at different speeds on Earth and in orbit (this is called relativistic drift). Your clock on Mars and your clock on Earth will disagree after only a few seconds.
            </p>

        <!-- Section Card: The "Quantum Clock" -->
        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>⏱️ V. The Solution: A Quantum Metronome</h2>
            <p>
                The solution proposed in the paper is a <span class="text-glow-gold">"quantum metronome."</span> It uses a property of quantum physics (entanglement-assisted synchronization) to create a shared, universal "tick-tock" that syncs every clock in the network instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be clear: the *data* is not sent this way. All data is sent on the classical, auditable "bell-ringing" channel. The quantum layer is used *only* for one job: to make sure all the clocks are perfectly in-sync, all the time.

        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>📊 VI. Proof: How We Know This Works</h2>
            <p>
                Is this just a theory? No. The paper proves it with <span class="text-glow-gold">Monte Carlo simulations</span>. This is a way of "rolling the dice" thousands of times.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team built a digital model of the Earth-Mars link and then blasted it with simulated solar storms (noise). They ran thousands of tests, and the results (shown in "ROC Curves") prove that the "beamforming" filters can pull the signal from the noise with extremely high accuracy (e.g., >95% detection) during quiet conditions, and *still* work (e.g., >80% detection) during moderate digital storms.

            <h2>🛰️ VII. A Smart, Self-Healing Network</h2>
            <p>
                Sky Pulse isn't just a signal; it's a network. The paper outlines two clever features. The first is <span class="text-glow-gold">"Harmonic Routing."</span> The network constantly checks which "note" (or frequency) has the clearest path and routes messages that way. If one note is noisy, it just hops to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second is <span class="text-glow-gold">"Quorum Consensus."</span> To ensure a message is real and not an error, a "quorum" (a minimum number) of nodes must all receive and validate the *same* message before it's passed on. It's a way for the network to fact-check itself in real-time.
            </p>

        <section class="sky-section">
            <h2>⚖️ VIII. Safety & Trust: A Public Ledger</h2>
            <p>
                Is this safe? The paper makes this a non-negotiable core principle. The "ring" is *billions* of times weaker ($\le10^{-9}$ T) than the Earth's own magnetic field. It's an environmentally-first design that respects the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                To prove it, every single transmission is recorded on a <span class="text-glow-gold">"Public Ledger."</span> Each experiment log is given a unique cryptographic "fingerprint" (a SHA-256 hash) and "chained" to the one before it. This creates an unchangeable, auditable log—a "blockchain for science"—that allows a public oversight board to verify no rules were broken.

            <h2>🌀 IX. The Deep Space Vision: Sipping Power from a Black Hole</h2>
            <p>
                This part is purely theoretical, but it shows the scale of the vision. How do you power a sensor relay in deep, deep space, far from the Sun? The paper includes a speculative model based on the <span class="text-glow-gold">"Blandford-Znajek"</span> mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short: this is a way to "sip" tiny amounts of rotational energy from a spinning black hole. By using the magnetic "drag" of the black hole's event horizon, a future relay could theoretically power itself forever, enabling the network to reach the farthest corners of the cosmos.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Phase 1: Planetary Core.</b> First, just map Earth's own "hum" (eigenmodes) and validate all the safety models.
                <br><b>Phase 2: Interplanetary Net.</b> Establish the first links between Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. This is where the quantum-synced clocks are deployed.
                <br><b>Phase 3: Deep-Space Pulse.</b> Send probes out into the "solar wind" to use the network in deep space, far from any planet.
                <br><b>Phase 4: Cosmic Net.</b> The long-term vision. Use pulsars or the BZ mechanism to create a network that spans the galaxy.
                <br><b>Phase 5: LUMI Layer.</b> The final and most important step. Build the human-facing tools (like this website!) to translate all this data into a shared, understandable story.

            <p>

            <p>
                The paper's final goal, the "LUMI Layer," is what you're looking at right now: a way to bridge the gap between hard, complex science and the human stories we need to tell.
